Hi.. my name is whdzera and I'm a 19 year old, programmer, and dairy free guy who's always been passionate about helping others.
I like building new stuff and work with other people, nothing really interesting is ever built alone.

My working philosophies is communication and collaboration with other developers and stakeholders is the key to a successful project, Use the right tool for the job. A programming language is just a tool and Always try to learn something new.
I consider myself advanced right now.
And of course it is always fun to learn something new about English.
